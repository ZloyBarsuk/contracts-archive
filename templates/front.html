<h2>WELCOME TO THE CONTRACTS FINDER ARCHIVE</h2>
<div class="ui inverted segment">
  <p>WARNING: This is archived data.</p>
</div>
<p>This site is a read only archive of historic contract data from the Business Link Contracts Finder website that closed in February 2015.</p>

<p>This site includes public sector contract tenders and contracts awarded between 11/2/2011 and 25/2/2015.</p>

<p>The site was superseded by a new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder">Contracts Finder (https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder)</a> designed and operated by the Crown Commercial Service.
Data from the current site is available in Open contracting Data standard format. For guidance on how to
access this please click <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-contractin">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Central government departments and its agencies were required to advertise contracts over &pound;10k on Contracts Finder (and this continues with the new Contract Finder). In addition the wider public sector were able to advertise contracts on there too, but weren't required (although on the new Contracts Finder they are required to on contracts over &pound;25k).</p>

<p>This data will not be updated and does not contain contracts which have been awarded since 26/2/2015. There was no batched copying of data from the old site to the new site, but there may have been transfers on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>This archive has been provided by the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> team using data from the Crown Commercial Service.</p>
